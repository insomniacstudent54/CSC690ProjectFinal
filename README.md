# CSC690ProjectFinal
This is for a final project in my CSC 690 class. This is an app I created, by using xcode 11 and swiftUI

This app is based off of an existing app called [Timecap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timecap-habit-tracker-timer/id1494584871). Timecap is an app that helps users build or destroy habits 
buy having the user check in if they have done the habit or not each day. The app also has a to do feature where 
users can input what they need to do and can check off the items they have done and delete them. 

My project will do something like this, however it's going to be the lite version. The Timecap app has a paid feature 
where it will allow you to see your stats on the habits you have been doing, with information like frequency, completion
days, and history. My app will just focus on the to do, and the habit breaker and builder parts.
